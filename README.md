## Ubuntufy Windows Unicode
This is a simple program that enables Unicode input on Windows machines the same way as many Linux and Unix variants (only confirmed on Ubuntu, but Wiki says it's the same on other variants aswell). 

There are two methods for direct input of Unicode characters:
* Hold [Ctrl]+[⇧ Shift] and type [U] followed by the hex digits. Then release [Ctrl]+[⇧ Shift].
* Enter [Ctrl]+[⇧ Shift]+[U], release, then type the hex digits, and press [↵ Enter] (or [Space]).

This is great if you have a computer without numpad and can't type Unicode characters.
